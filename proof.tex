\section{Proof of the Theorems}
\label{section:differentiable}

The proofs of Theorems \ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} and \ref{KTimesIsCH}
proceed as follows. 
In Section~\ref{section:divp}, 
we define \emph{difference equations}, 
a discrete version of the differential equations. 
In Section~\ref{subsection: counting hierarchy}, 
we show the $\classPSPACE$- and $\classCH$-hardness of 
difference equations with certain restrictions. 
In Section~\ref{subsection: ode family}, 
we show that these classes of difference equations can be simulated
by families of differential equations 
satisfying certain uniform bounds on higher-order derivatives. 
In Section~\ref{subsection: proof of theorems}, 
we prove the theorems by
putting these families of functions together 
to obtain one differential equation 
having the desired smoothness 
($\classC ^{(\infty, 1)}$ and $\classC ^{(\infty, k)}$). 

The idea of simulating a discrete system of limited feedback capability
by differential equations
was essentially already present in the proof of 
the Lipschitz version \cite{kawamura2010lipschitz}. 
% As explained there, the main idea 
% was to simulate $\classPSPACE$ computation by a discrete system 
% whose feedback capability is limited
% so that it could be simulated by a trajectory of 
% a Lipschitz continuous differential equation. 
We look more closely at this limited feedback mechanism, 
and observe that this restriction is one on the \emph{height}
of the difference equation. 
We show that a stronger height restriction makes
the difference equation simulatable by 
smoother differential equations, 
leading to the $\classCH$-hardness for $\classC ^{(\infty, k)}$ functions.

\subsection{Difference Equations}
\label{section:divp}

In this section, we define difference equations, 
a discrete version of differential equations,
and show the $\classPSPACE$- and $\classCH$-hardness of 
families of difference equations with different height restrictions. 

Let $[n]$ denote $\{0, \dots , n-1\}$.
Let $G \colon [P] \times [Q] \times [R] \to \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and
$H \colon [P + 1] \times [Q+1] \to [R]$. 
We say that $H$ is the solution of the \emph{difference equation} given by $G$
if for all $i \in [P]$ and $T \in [Q]$ (Figure~\ref{fig:divp}), 
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=0.15\textheight]{image/divp.eps}
 \end{center}
 \caption{The solution $H$ of the difference equation given by $G$}
 \label{fig:divp}
\end{figure}
\begin{gather}
   H(i, 0) = H(0, T) = 0, \label{eq:initial value}
\\
   H(i + 1, T + 1) - H(i+1, T) = G(i, T, H(i, T)).  \label{eq:divp}
\end{gather}
We call $P$, $Q$ and $R$ the \emph{height}, \emph{width} and \emph{cell size} of
the difference equation.
The equations \eqref{eq:initial value} and \eqref{eq:divp} are similar to 
the initial condition $h(0) = 0$ and the equation $\D h(t) = g(t, h(t))$ 
in \eqref{eq:ode}.
In Section~\ref{subsection: ode family}, we will simulate difference equations by differential equations using this similarity.

We view a family of difference equations as a computing system by
regarding the value of the bottom right cell (the gray cell in Figure~\ref{fig:divp}) as the output. 
A family $(G_u)_u$ of functions 
$G_u \colon [P_u] \times [Q_u] \times [R_u] \to \{-1, 0, 1\}$
\emph{recognizes} a language $L$ if for each $u$,
the difference equation given by $G_u$ has a solution $H_u$ 
and $H_u(P_u, Q_u) = L(u)$.
A family $(G_u)_u$ is \emph{uniform} 
if the height, width and cell size of $G_u$ are 
polynomial-time computable from $u$ (in particular, 
they must be bounded by $2^{p(|u|)}$, for some polynomial~$p$)
and $G_u(i, T, Y)$ is polynomial-time computable from $(u, i, T, Y)$.
A family $(G_u)_u$ has \emph{polynomial height} if the height $P_u$ is bounded by some polynomial $p(|u|)$.
A family $(G_u)_u$ has \emph{logarithmic height} if the height $P_u$ is bounded by $c \log |u| + d$ with some constants $c$ and $d$.
With this terminology,
the key lemma in 
\cite[Lemma 4.7]{kawamura2010lipschitz} 
can be written as follows:
\begin{lemma}
 \label{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard}
 There exists a $\classPSPACE$-hard language $L$ that is recognized by some uniform family of functions with polynomial height%
 \footnote{In fact, the languages recognized by 
 uniform families with polynomial height coincide with $\classPSPACE$.
}.
\end{lemma}

Kawamura obtained the hardness result in the third row in Table \ref{table:related} 
by simulating the difference equations of Lemma~\ref{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard}
by Lipschitz-continuous differential equations. 
Likewise, 
Theorem~\ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} follows from Lemma~\ref{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard},
by a modified construction that keeps 
the function in class $\classC ^{(\infty, 1)}$ 
(Sections \ref{subsection: ode family} and \ref{subsection: proof of theorems}).

We show further that 
difference equations restricted to have logarithmic height can be simulated by
$\classC ^{(\infty, k)}$ functions for each $k$ 
(Sections \ref{subsection: ode family} and \ref{subsection: proof of theorems}).
Theorem \ref{KTimesIsCH} follows from this simulation and the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
 \label{DIVPlogIsCHhard}
 There exists a $\classCH$-hard language $L$ that is recognized by some uniform family of functions with logarithmic height.
\end{lemma}

The definition of the counting hierarchy $\classCH$, 
its connection to difference equations and 
the proof of Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard} 
will be presented in Section~\ref{subsection: counting hierarchy}. 



\subsection{The Counting Hierarchy and Difference Equations of Logarithmic Height}
\label{subsection: counting hierarchy}

The polynomial hierarchy~$\classPH$ is defined using non-deterministic polynomial-time oracle Turing machines: 
\begin{align}
 \classSigma^p_0  &= \classP,
 &
 \classSigma^p_{n+1} &= \classNP ^{\classSigma^p_n},
 &
 \classPH &= \bigcup_n \classSigma^p_n.
\end{align}
The counting hierarchy~$\classCH$
is defined similarly
using probabilistic polynomial-time oracle Turing machines~%
\cite{wagner1986complexity,toran1991complexity}: 
\begin{align} \label{eq:CH}
 \quantC_0 \classP  &= \classP,
 &
 \quantC_{n+1} \classP &= \classPP^{\quantC_n \classP},
 &
 \classCH &= \bigcup_n \quantC_n \classP.
\end{align}
It is known that $\classPH \subseteq \classCH \subseteq \classPSPACE$, 
but we do not know whether $\classPH = \classPSPACE$.


Each level of the counting hierarchy 
has a complete problem defined as follows.
For every formula $\phi(X)$ with the list $X$ of $l$ free propositional variables,
we write 
\begin{equation}
 \quantC^m X \phi(X) 
  \longleftrightarrow 
  \sum_{X \in \{0,1\}^l} \phi(X) \ge m,
\end{equation}
where $\phi(X)$ is identified with the function 
$\phi \colon \{0,1\}^l \to \{0,1\}$
such that $\phi(X) = 1$ when $\phi(X)$ is true.
This ``counting quantifier'' $\quantC ^m$ generalizes 
the usual quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$, 
because $\quantC^1 = \exists$ and $\quantC^{2^l} = \forall$.
For lists $X _1$, \ldots, $X _n$ of variables 
and a formula $\phi(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ with all free variables listed, 
we define
\begin{equation}
 \langle \phi(X_1, \dots, X_n), m_1, \dots, m_n \rangle \in \quantC_n B_{be}
 \longleftrightarrow
 \quantC^{m_1}{X_1} \cdots \quantC^{m_n}{X_n} \phi(X_1, \dots, X_n).
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Theorem 7]{wagner1986complexity}}] \label{lemma:CnP-complete}
 For every $n \ge 1$, 
 the problem $\quantC_n B_{be}$ is $\quantC_n\classP$-complete.
\end{lemma}

We define a problem $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$ by
\begin{equation}
 \langle 0^{2^n}, u \rangle \in \quantC_{\log} B_{be}
 \longleftrightarrow
 u \in \quantC_n B_{be}.
\end{equation}
We show that $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$ 
is $\classCH$-hard and recognized by a logarithmic-height uniform function family,
as required in Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard}. 

\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard}]
First we prove that $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$ is $\classCH$-hard.
For each problem $A$ in $\classCH$, there is a constant $n$ such that $A \in \quantC_n \classP$.
From Lemma~\ref{lemma:CnP-complete}, for each $u \in \{0,1\}^*$
there is a polynomial-time function $f_n$ such that
$u \in A \leftrightarrow f_n(u) \in \quantC_n B_{be}$. So
\begin{align}
 u \in A 
 & \longleftrightarrow \langle 0^{2^n}, f_n(u) \rangle \in \quantC_{\log} B_{be}.
\end{align}
Since $\langle 0^{2^n}, f_n(\cdot) \rangle$ is polynomial time computable,
$A$ is reducible to $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$.


Next we construct a logarithmic-height uniform function family $(G_u)_u$
recognizing $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$.
Let $u  = \langle 0^{2^n}, 
\langle \phi(X_1, \dots, X_n), m_1, \dots, m_n \rangle \rangle$, 
where $n$, $m_1, \dots, m_n$ are nonnegative integers 
and $\phi$ is a formula. 
(If $u$ is not of this form, then $u \notin \quantC_{\log} B_{be}$.)
 
We write $l_i = |X_i|$ and $s_i = i + \sum^i_{j=1}l_j$.
For each $i \in \{0, \dots, n\}$ and
$Y_{i+1} \in \{0,1\}^{l_{i+1}}, \dots, Y_n \in \{0,1\}^{l_n}$,
we write $\phi_i(Y_{i+1}, \dots, Y_n)$ for the truth value of the subformula
$\quantC^{m_{i}}{X_i} \cdots \quantC^{m_1}{X_1} \phi(X_1, \dots, X_i, Y_{i+1}, \dots, Y_n)$,
so that $\phi_0 = \phi$ and $\phi_n() = \quantC_{\log} B_{be} (u)$.
We regard the quantifier $\quantC^m$ as a function from $\N$ to $\{0,1\}$:
\begin{equation}
 C^m(x) 
  = \begin{cases}
     1 & \text{if} \ x \ge m, \\
     0 & \text{if} \ x < m.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi-step}
 \phi_{i+1}(Y_{i+2}, \dots, Y_n) 
  = C^{m_{i+1}}\left(\sum_{X_{i+1} \in \{ 0,1 \} ^{l_i}}
		\phi_i(X_{i+1}, Y_{i+2}, \dots, Y_{n})\right).
\end{equation}
For $T \in \N$, we write $T_i$ for the $i$th digit of $T$ written in binary,
and $T_{[i,j]}$ for the string $T_{j-1} T_{j-2} \cdots T_{i+1} T_{i}$.

For each $(i, T, Y) \in [n+1] \times [2^{s_n}+1] \times [2^{|u|}]$,
we define $G_u (i, T, Y)$ as follows.
The first row is given by
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:def-Gu:case0}
  G_u(0,T,Y) = 
   (-1)^{T_{s_1}}\phi(T_{[1,s_1]}, T_{[s_1+1,s_2]},
    \dots, T_{[s_{n-1}+1,s_n]}), 
 \end{equation}
and for $i \neq 0$, we define 
 \begin{equation} 
  G_u(i,T,Y) = 
   \begin{cases}
    (-1)^{T_{s_{i+1}}} C^{m_i}(Y) 
    & \text{if} \ T_{[1,s_i+1]} = 10 \cdots 0, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
   \end{cases} 
   \label{eq:def-Gu:case-nonzero}
 \end{equation}
Define $H_u$ from $G_u$ by \eqref{eq:initial value} and \eqref{eq:divp}.

We prove by induction on $i$ that $H_u(i, T) \in [2^{l_i}]$ for all $T$, and that 
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:subformula}
  G_u(i,V,H_u(i,V)) = (-1)^{V_{s_{i+1}}} 
   \phi_i(V_{[s_i+1, s_{i+1}]}, \dots, V_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]})
 \end{equation}
if $V_{[1, s_i +1]} = 10 \cdots 0$.
We put the details in Appendix \ref{appendix:proof-subformula}.

By substituting $n$ for $i$ and $2^{s_n}$ for $T$ in \eqref{eq:subformula},
we get $G_u(n, 2^{s_n}, H_u(n,2^{s_n})) = \phi_n() = \quantC_{\log} B_{be}(u)$.
Hence $H_u(n+1, 2^{s_n}+1) = \quantC_{\log} B_{be}(u)$.
 
We show that $(G_u)_u$ is uniform and has logarithmic height. 
The height $n+1$, the width $2^{s_n}+1$, and the cell size $2^{|u|}$
of $G_u$ are polynomial-time computable from $u$, 
and $n+1 \le \log |0^{2^n}| + 1 \le \log|u| + 1$.
\qed
\end{proof}


The class of languages recognized by uniform function families with $i$ rows
contains $\quantC_i \classP$ (the $i$th level of the counting hierarchy)
and is contained in $\quantC_{i+1} \classP$.
While the class $\quantC_i \classP$ is defined by \eqref{eq:CH} using oracle Turing machines,
it can be also characterized as those languages Karp-reducible to $\quantC_i B_{be}$, or 
as those accepted by a polynomial-time alternating Turing machine 
extended with ``threshold states'' and having at most $i$ alternations.
Likewise, 
the languages accepted by uniform function families of logarithmic height
coincide with those Karp-reducible to $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$
and with those accepted by the extended alternating Turing machine with logarithmic alternations.
% Since this class contains $\classCH$,
% we only state $\classCH$-hardness in Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} and Theorem $\ref{KTimesIsCH}$,
% but it is not known such class how hard the class is between $\classCH$ and $\classPSPACE$.



\subsection{Families of Real Functions Simulating Difference Equations}
\label{subsection: ode family}
We show that certain families of smooth differential equations can simulate 
$\classPSPACE$- or $\classCH$-hard difference equations stated in previous section.

Before stating Lemmas~\ref{KTimesFamily} and \ref{DifferentiableFamily},
we extend the definition of polynomial-time computability of real function
to families of real functions.
A machine $M$ \emph{computes} a family $(f_u)_u$ of functions $f _u \colon A \to \R$ 
indexed by strings $u$
if for any $x \in A$ and any name $\phi_x$ of $x$,
the function taking $v$ to $M ^{\phi _x} (u, v)$ is a name of $f _u (x)$.
We say a family of real functions $(f_u)_u$ is polynomial-time if there is
a polynomial-time machine computing $(f_u)_u$.

 \begin{lemma}
  \label{KTimesFamily}
  There exist a $\classCH$-hard language $L$ and a polynomial $\mu$,
  such that for any $k \ge 1$ and polynomials $\gamma$,
  there are a polynomial $\rho$ and families $(g_u)_u$, $(h_u)_u$ of real functions
  such that $(g_u)_u$ is polynomial-time computable and for any string $u$:
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item \label{enum:kf:start}
	 $g_u\colon [0,1] \times [-1,1]\to \R$, $h_u\colon [0,1] \to [-1,1]$;
   \item \label{enum:equation}
	 $h_u(0) = 0$ and $\D h_u(t) = g_u(t, h_u(t))$ for all $t \in [0,1]$;
   \item \label{enum:differentiability}
         $g_u$ is of class $\classC^{(\infty, k)}$;
   \item \label{enum:boundary}
	 $
	 \D^{(i, 0)} g_u(0,y) = \D^{(i, 0)} g_u(1,y) = 0
         $ for all $i \in \N$ and $y \in [-1,1]$;
   \item \label{enum:smooth}
	 $
	 \left|\D^{(i,j)} g_u(t,y)\right| \le 2^{\mu(i, |u|) - \gamma(|u|)}
         $ for all $i \in \N$ and $j \in \{0, \dots, k\}$;
   \item \label{enum:kf:end}
	 $h_u(1) = 2^{-\rho(|u|)} L(u)$.
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
 \label{DifferentiableFamily}
 There exist a $\classPSPACE$-hard language $L$ and a polynomial $\mu$,
 such that for any polynomial $\gamma$,
 there are a polynomial $\rho$ and families $(g_u)_u$, $(h_u)_u$ of real functions
 such that $(g_u)_u$ is polynomial-time computable and for any string $u$
 satisfying (\ref{enum:kf:start})--(\ref{enum:kf:end}) of Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} with $k = 1$.
\end{lemma}

We will prove Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} using Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard} as follows.
Let a function family $(G_u)_u$ be as in Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard},
and let $(H_u)_u$ be the family of the solutions of the difference equations given by $(G_u)_u$.
We construct $h_u$ and $g_u$ from $H_u$ and $G_u$ 
such that $h_u(T/2^{q(|u|)}) = \sum^{p(|u|)}_{i = 0} H_u(i, T)/B^{d_u(i)}$ for each $T = 0$, \ldots, $2^{q(|u|)}$
and $\D h_u(t) = g_u(t, h_u(t))$.
The polynomial-time computability of $(g_u)_u$ follows from that of $(G_u)_u$.
We can prove Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily} from Lemma~\ref{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard} in the same way.
We put detailed proofs of Lemmas~\ref{KTimesFamily} and \ref{DifferentiableFamily}
in Appendix~\ref{appendix:proof-family}.


\subsection{Proof of the Main Theorems}
\label{subsection: proof of theorems}
Using the function families $(g_u)_u$ and $(h_u)_u$ 
obtained from Lemmas \ref{KTimesFamily} or \ref{DifferentiableFamily}, 
we construct the functions $g$ and $h$ in 
Theorems \ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} and \ref{KTimesIsCH} as follows. 
Divide $[0,1)$ into infinitely many subintervals $[l^-_u, l^+_u]$,
with midpoints $c_u$.
We construct $h$ by putting a scaled copy of $h_u$ onto $[l^-_u, c_u]$ and
putting a horizontally reversed scaled copy of $h_u$ onto $[c_u, l^+_u]$ 
so that $h(l^-_u) = 0$, $h(c_u) = 2^{-\rho'(|u|)} L(u)$ and $h(l^+_u) = 0$ where $\rho'$ is a polynomial.
In the same way, $g$ is constructed from $(g_u)_u$ so that $g$ and $h$ satisfy \eqref{eq:ode}.
We give the details of the proof of 
Theorem~\ref{KTimesIsCH} from Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily}, 
and omit the analogous proof of Theorem~\ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} 
from Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily}. 


\begin{proof}[Theorem~\ref{KTimesIsCH}]
Let $L$ and $\mu$ be as Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily}.
Define
$
  \lambda(x) = 2x + 2
$, $
  \gamma(x) = \mu(x, x) + x \lambda(x)
$
and for each $u$ let
$
 \Lambda_u = 2^{\lambda(|u|)}
$, $
 c_u = 1-{2^{-|u|}}+{2\bar{u}+1}/{\Lambda_u}
$, $
 l_u^\mp = c_u\mp{1}/{\Lambda_u}
$,
 where $\bar u \in \{0, \dots, 2^{|u|} - 1\}$ is the number represented by $u$ in binary notation.
Let $\rho$, $(g_u)_u$, $(h_u)_u$ be as in Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} 
corresponding to the above $\gamma$.

We define
 \begin{align} \label{eq:g}
 g \left(l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u}, \frac{y}{\Lambda_u}\right)
  &= \begin{cases}
      \pm \displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{\D^{(0,l)}g_u(t,1)}{l!} (y-1)^l 
      &  \text{if} \ 1<y, \\
      \pm g_u(t, y)      & \text{if} \ {-1} \le y \le 1, \\
      \pm \displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{\D^{(0,l)}g_u(t,-1)}{l!} (y+1)^l  
      &  \text{if} \ 1<y, \\
    \end{cases} 
  \\
 h \left( l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u} \right) 
  & = \frac{h_u(t)}{\Lambda_u}
\end{align}
for each string $u$ and $t \in [0,1)$, $y \in [-1, 1]$.
Let $g(1,y) = 0$ and $h(1) = 0$ for any $y \in [-1,1]$.

It can be shown similarly to the Lipschitz version 
\cite[Theorem 3.2]{kawamura2010lipschitz}
that $g$ and $h$ satisfy \eqref{eq:ode} and $g$ is polynomial-time computable.
Here we only prove that $g$ is of class $\classC^{(\infty, k)}$.
We claim that 
for each $i \in \N$ and $j \in \{0, \dots, k\}$, 
the derivative $\D _1 ^i \D _2 ^j g$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
   \D_1^i \D_2^j g \left(l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u}, \frac{y}{\Lambda_u}\right)
   = \begin{cases}
      \pm \Lambda_u^{i+j} \sum^{k}_{l=j} \frac{\D^{(i,l)} g_u(t,1)}{(l-j)!}
      (y - 1)^l &  \text{if } y < -1,
      \\
      \pm \Lambda_u^{i+j} \D^{(i, j)} g_u(t, y) & \text{if } {-1} \le y \le 1,
      \\
      \pm \Lambda_u^{i+j} \sum^{k}_{l=j} 
      \frac{\D^{(i,l)} g_u(t, -1)}{(l-j)!} (y + 1)^l &  \text{if } 1<y
    \end{cases}  \label{eq:d1id2jg}
\end{equation}
for each $l_u^\mp \pm t/\Lambda_u \in [0,1)$ and $y/\Lambda_u \in [-1, 1]$, 
and by $\D _1 ^i \D _2 ^j g (1, y) = 0$. 
This is verified by induction on $i + j$. 
The equation \eqref{eq:d1id2jg} follows from calculation 
(note that this means verifying 
that \eqref{eq:d1id2jg} follows from the definition of $g$ when $i = j = 0$; 
from the induction hypothesis about $\D _2 ^{j - 1} g$ when $i = 0$ and $j > 0$; 
and from the induction hypothesis about $\D _1 ^{i - 1} \D _2 ^j g$ when $i > 0$).
That $\D _1 ^i \D _2 ^j g (1, y) = 0$ is 
immediate from the induction hypothesis if $i = 0$. 
If $i > 0$, the derivative
$\D_1^i \D_2^j g (1, y)$ is by definition the limit 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{s \to 1 - 0} \frac{\D_1^{i-1} \D_2^j g(1, y) - \D_1^{i-1} \D_2^j g (s, y)}{1 - s}.
\label{eq:limitofderivative}
\end{equation}
This can be shown to exist and equal $0$, 
by observing that the first term in the numerator is $0$
and the second term is bounded, when $s \in [l ^- _u, l ^+ _u]$, by 
 \begin{align}
&
  \lvert
   \D_1^{i-1} \D_2^j g (s, y)
  \rvert
  \le 
  \Lambda_u^{i-1+j} \sum^{k}_{l=j} \lvert \D^{(i-1,l)} g_u \rvert \cdot (\Lambda_u + 1)^l 
  \notag
\\
& \qquad
 \le
  \Lambda_u^{i-1+j}  \cdot k \cdot 2^{\mu(i-1, |u|) - \gamma(|u|)} \cdot (2\Lambda_u)^k
  \notag
\\
& \qquad
  \le 2^{(i-1+j+k)\lambda(|u|) + 2k + \mu(i-1, |u|)  - \gamma(|u|)}
  \le 2^{-2 \lvert u \rvert}
  \le 2^{-\lvert u \rvert + 1} (1 - s), 
  \label{eq:sizeofderivative}
 \end{align}
where the second inequality is from 
Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} (\ref{enum:smooth})
and the fourth inequality holds for sufficiently large $\lvert u \rvert$
by our choice of $\gamma$. 
The continuity of $\D _1 ^i \D _2 ^j g$ on $[0,1) \times [-1, 1]$ follows
from \eqref{eq:d1id2jg} and Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} (\ref{enum:boundary}).
Continuity on $\{1\} \times [-1, 1]$ is verified by 
estimating $\D_1^{i} \D_2^{j} g$ similarly to \eqref{eq:sizeofderivative}. 
\qed
\end{proof}
