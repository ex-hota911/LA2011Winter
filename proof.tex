\section{Proof of The Theorems}
\label{section:differentiable}

We give a proof sketch of Theorem~\ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} and Theorem~\ref{KTimesIsCH}.
First we define a discrete version of differential equations in Section~\ref{section:divp},
and show $\classPSPACE$-hardness or $\classCH$-hardness of the problem with 
restrictions similar to once differentiable or $k$-times differentiable
in Section~\ref{subsection: counting hierarchy}.
In Section~\ref{subsection: ode family}, 
we show that these discrete problems is simulatable
by certain families of smooth differential equations.
We construct the smooth differential equations stated in theorems
putting one family into one real function
in Section~\ref{subsection: proof of theorems}.
Henceforth we call the discrete version of differential equations as difference equations.

The idea to simulate difference equations with differential equations
is essentially from the proof of Lipschitz version \cite{kawamura2010lipschitz}.
In this paper we focus on the structure of difference equations
to analyze precisely the effect of the smoothness restriction.
Consequently we show with the restriction differentiable more than once
differential equations can simulate difference equations whose height is enough small, and it gives the $\classCH$-hardness of smooth differential equations.

\subsection{Difference Equations}
\label{section:divp}

This section we define difference equations, which is a discrete version of differential,
and show that $\classPSPACE$-hardness or $\classCH$-hardness depending on restrictions on height.

Let $[n]$ denote $\{0, \dots , n-1\}$.
Let $G \colon [P] \times [Q] \times [R] \to \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and
$H \colon [P + 1] \times [Q+1] \to [R]$,
$H$ is the solution of the \emph{difference equation} given by $G$
if for all $i \in [P]$ and $T \in [Q]$(Figure~\ref{fig:divp}), 
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=0.15\textheight]{image/divp.eps}
 \end{center}
 \caption{差分方程式$G$とその解$H$}
 \label{fig:divp}
\end{figure}
\begin{gather}
   H(i, 0) = H(0, T) = 0 \label{eq:initial value}
\\
   H(i + 1, T + 1) - H(i+1, T) = G(i, T, H(i, T)).  \label{eq:divp}
\end{gather}
We call $P$, $Q$ and $R$ as \emph{height}, \emph{width}, \emph{cell size} of
the difference equation.
The equation \eqref{eq:initial value} is similar to 
the initial condition $h(0) = 0$,
and \eqref{eq:divp} is similar to $\D h(t) = g(t, h(t))$
in \eqref{eq:ode}.
In Section~\ref{subsection: ode family}, we simulate difference equations by differential equations using this similarity.

We regard a family of difference equations $(G_u)_u$ computing $L$,
by regarding the value of the bottom right cell as $L(u)$ for each $u$.
A family $(G_u)_u$ of functions 
$G_u \colon [P_u] \times [Q_u] \times [R_u] \to \{-1, 0, 1\}$
\emph{recognizes} a language $L$ if
let $(H_u)_u$ be as the solution of the difference equation given by $G_u$
$H_u(P_u, Q_u) = L(u)$.
A family $(G_u)_u$ is \emph{uniform} 
if the height and width and cell size of $G_u$ are polynomial-time computable from $u$
and $G_u(i, T, Y)$ is polynomial-time computable from $(u, i, T, Y)$.
Note that height, width and cell size of a uniform $G_u$ is bounded by $2^{p(|u|)}$ where $p$ is some polynomial.
A family $(G_u)_u$ has \emph{polynomial height} if the height $P_u$ is bounded by some polynomial $p(|u|)$.
A family $(G_u)_u$ has \emph{logarithmic height} if the height $P_u$ is bounded by $c \log |u| + d$ where some constants $c$ and $d$.
In terms of these definition,
\cite[補題4.7]{kawamura2010lipschitz}, which proved by Kawamura to show 
that $\classPSPACE$-hardness of Lipschitz version,
can be written in following form:
\begin{lemma}
 \label{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard}
 There exists a $\classPSPACE$-hard language such that it is recognized by some uniform family of functions with polynomial height.
 \footnote{The language class recognized by difference equations
 is closed under Karp reduction and the language class recognized by 
 uniform families with polynomial height coincides $\classPSPACE$.
 }.
\end{lemma}

By simulating this difference equation using certain Lipschitz differential equation,
Kawamura obtained the result at the third row in Table \ref{table:related}.
Also Theorem \ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} follows from Lemma \ref{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard},
by arranging the construction of $g$ and $h$ so that $g$ is 
$(\infty, 1)$-times differential(Section \ref{subsection: ode family} and Section \ref{subsection: proof of theorems}).

In this paper, we show real functions differentiable more than once in $x$ can simulate
difference equations restricted to have logarithmic height
(Section~\ref{subsection: ode family} and Section~\ref{subsection: proof of theorems}).
Theorem \ref{KTimesIsCH} follows from the above argument with the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
 \label{DIVPlogIsCHhard}
 There exists a $\classCH$-hard language such that it is recognized by some uniform family of functions with logarithmic height.
\end{lemma}


In the next section we provide 
the definition of the counting hierarchy($\classCH$),
its connection with difference equations and 
the proof of this lemma.


\subsection{The Counting Hierarchy and Difference Equations of Logarithmic Height}
\label{subsection: counting hierarchy}

The polynomial hierarchy~$\classPH$ is defined using non-deterministic polynomial-time oracle Turing machines: 
\begin{align}
 \classSigma^p_0  &= \classP,
 &
 \classSigma^p_{n+1} &= \classNP ^{\classSigma^p_n},
 &
 \classPH &= \bigcup_n \classSigma^p_n.
\end{align}
In the same way, the counting hierarchy~$\classCH$
\cite{wagner1986complexity} 
is defined
using probabilistic polynomial-time oracle Turing machines%
\footnote{This characterization, introduced by Tor{\'a}n 
in \cite{toran1991complexity}, is different from Wagner's original one.
}: 
\begin{align} \label{eq:CH}
 \quantC_0 \classP  &= \classP,
 &
 \quantC_{n+1} \classP &= \classPP^{\quantC_n \classP},
 &
 \classCH &= \bigcup_n \quantC_n \classP.
\end{align}
It is known that $\classPH \subseteq \classCH \subseteq \classPSPACE$, 
but we do not know whether $\classPH = \classPSPACE$.


Each level of the counting hierarchy 
has a complete problem defined as follows.
For every formula $\phi(X)$ with the list $X$ of $l$ free propositional variables,
we write 
\begin{equation}
 \quantC^m X \phi(X) 
  \longleftrightarrow 
  \sum_{X \in \{0,1\}^l} \phi(X) \ge m,
\end{equation}
where $\phi(X)$ is identified with the function 
$\phi \colon \{0,1\}^l \to \{0,1\}$
such that $\phi(X) = 1$ if and only if $\phi(X)$ is true.
This ``counting quantifier'' $\quantC ^m$ generalizes 
the usual quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$, 
because $\quantC^1 = \exists$ and $\quantC^{2^l} = \forall$.
For lists $X _1$, \ldots, $X _n$ of variables 
and a formula $\phi(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ with all free variables listed, 
we define
\begin{equation}
 \langle \phi(X_1, \dots, X_n), m_1, \dots, m_n \rangle \in \quantC_n B_{be}
 \longleftrightarrow
 \quantC^{m_1}{X_1} \cdots \quantC^{m_n}{X_n} \phi(X_1, \dots, X_n).
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Theorem 7]{wagner1986complexity}}] \label{lemma:CnP-complete}
 For every $n \ge 1$, 
 the problem $\quantC_n B_{be}$ is $\quantC_n\classP$-complete.
\end{lemma}

We define a problem $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$ by
\begin{equation}
 \langle 0^{2^n}, u \rangle \in \quantC_{\log} B_{be}
 \longleftrightarrow
 u \in \quantC_n B_{be}.
\end{equation}
We show that $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$ 
is $\classCH$-hard and recognized by a logarithmic-height uniform function family,
as required in Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard}. 

\begin{proof}[\textup{Proof of Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard}}]
First we prove that $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$ is $\classCH$-hard.
For each problem $A$ in $\classCH$, there is a constant $n$ such that $A \in \quantC_n \classP$.
From Lemma~\ref{lemma:CnP-complete}, for each $u \in \{0,1\}^*$
there is a polynomial-time function $f_n$ such that
$u \in A \leftrightarrow f_n(u) \in \quantC_n B_{be}$. So
\begin{align}
 u \in A 
 & \longleftrightarrow \langle 0^{2^n}, f_n(u) \rangle \in \quantC_{\log} B_{be}.
\end{align}
Since $\langle 0^{2^n}, f_n(\cdot) \rangle$ is polynomial time computable,
$A$ is reducible to $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$.


Next we construct a logarithmic-height uniform function family $(G_u)_u$
recognizing $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$.
Let $u  = \langle 0^{2^n}, 
\langle \phi(X_1, \dots, X_n), m_1, \dots, m_n \rangle \rangle$, 
where $n$, $m_1, \dots, m_n$ are nonnegative integers 
and $\phi$ is a formula. 
(If $u$ is not of this form, then $u \notin \quantC_{\log} B_{be}$.)
 
We write $l_i = |X_i|$ and $s_i = i + \sum^i_{j=1}l_j$.
For each $i \in \{0, \dots, n\}$ and
$Y_{i+1} \in \{0,1\}^{l_{i+1}}, \dots, Y_n \in \{0,1\}^{l_n}$,
we write $\phi_i(Y_{i+1}, \dots, Y_n)$ for the truth value of the subformula
$\quantC^{m_{i}}{X_i} \cdots \quantC^{m_1}{X_1} \phi(X_1, \dots, X_i, Y_{i+1}, \dots, Y_n)$,
so that $\phi_0 = \phi$ and $\phi_n() = \quantC_{\log} B_{be} (u)$.
We regard the quantifier $\quantC^m$ as a function from $\N$ to $\{0,1\}$:
\begin{equation}
 C^m(x) 
  = \begin{cases}
     1 & \text{if} \ x \ge m, \\
     0 & \text{if} \ x < m.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi-step}
 \phi_{i+1}(Y_{i+2}, \dots, Y_n) 
  = C^{m_{i+1}}\left(\sum_{X_{i+1} \in \{ 0,1 \} ^{l_i}}
		\phi_i(X_{i+1}, Y_{i+2}, \dots, Y_{n})\right).
\end{equation}
For $T \in \N$, we write $T_i$ for the $i$th digit of $T$ written in binary,
and $T_{[i,j]}$ for the string $T_{j-1} T_{j-2} \cdots T_{i+1} T_{i}$.

For each $(i, T, Y) \in [n+1] \times [2^{s_n}+1] \times [2^{|u|}]$,
we define $G_u (i, T, Y)$ as follows.
The first row is given by
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:def-Gu:case0}
  G_u(0,T,Y) = 
   (-1)^{T_{s_1}}\phi(T_{[1,s_1]}, T_{[s_1+1,s_2]},
    \dots, T_{[s_{n-1}+1,s_n]}), 
 \end{equation}
and for $i \neq 0$, we define 
 \begin{equation} 
  G_u(i,T,Y) = 
   \begin{cases}
    (-1)^{T_{s_{i+1}}} C^{m_i}(Y) 
    & \text{if} \ T_{[1,s_i+1]} = 10 \cdots 0, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
   \end{cases} 
 \end{equation}
Define $H_u$ from $G_u$ by \eqref{eq:initial value} and \eqref{eq:divp}.

We prove by induction on $i$ that $H_u(i, T) \in [2^{l_u}]$ for all $T$, and that
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:subformula}
  G_u(i,T,H_u(i,V)) = (-1)^{V_{s_{i+1}}} 
   \phi_i(V_{[s_i+1, s_{i+1}]}, \dots, V_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]})
 \end{equation}
for all $i \in [n+1]$ and $V \in [2^{s_n}+1]$
such that $V_{[1, s_i +1]} = 10 \cdots 0$.

For $i=0$, the claims follows from \eqref{eq:def-Gu:case0}.
For the induction step, assume \eqref{eq:subformula}. 
We have
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:summation}
  H_u(i+1, T) 
  = \sum_{V = 0}^{T-1} G_u(i, V, H_u(i, V)) 
  = \sum_{V} (-1)^{V_{s_{i+1}}} \phi_i(V_{[s_i+1, s_{i+1}]}, 
   \dots, V_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]}),
 \end{equation}
where we write $\overline U$ for the number represented by string $U$ as binary expression.
For each $V < \overline{T_{[s_{i+1}+1, s_n]} 0 \cdots 0}$ in \eqref{eq:summation},
the terms $\phi_i(V_{[s_i+1, s_{i+1}]}, \dots, V_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]})$ and
 $- \phi_i(V_{[s_i+1, s_{i+1}]}, \dots, V_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]}) = 0$ cancel each other out. Then 
 \begin{equation}
  H_u(i+1, T) = \sum_{X \in \{0,1\}^{l_i}}
  \phi_i(X, T_{[s_{i+1}+1, s_{i+2}]}, \dots, T_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]}).
 \end{equation}
 From this equation and \eqref{eq:phi-step}, it follows that
 \begin{align}
  G_u(i+1,T,H_u(i+1,T)) 
  &= (-1)^{T_{s_{i+2}}} C^{m_{i+1}} (H_u(i+1, T))
\notag
\\
  &= (-1)^{T_{s_{i+2}}} \phi_{i+1}(T_{[s_{i+1}+1, s_{i+2}]}, \dots, T_{[s_{n-1}+1, s_n]}).
 \end{align}


By substituting $n$ for $i$ and $2^{s_n}$ for $T$ in \eqref{eq:subformula},
we get $G_u(n, 2^{s_n}, H_u(n,2^{s_n})) = \phi_n() = \quantC_{\log} B_{be}(u)$.
Hence $H_u(n+1, 2^{s_n}+1) = \quantC_{\log} B_{be}(u)$.
 
The height $n+1$, the width $2^{s_n}+1$, and the cell size $2^{|u|}$
of $G_u$ are polynomial-time computable from $u$, 
and $n+1 \le \log(|0^{2^n}|) + 1 \le \log|u| + 1$.
Hence $(G_u)_u$ is uniform and has logarithmic height. 
\end{proof}


The language class recognized by uniform function families with $i$ rows
contains $\quantC_i \classP$ (the $i$th level of the counting hierarchy)
and is contained in $\quantC_{i+1} \classP$.
While the class $\quantC_i \classP$ is defined by \eqref{eq:CH} using oracle Turing machines,
it is also characterized as those languages Karp-reducible to $\quantC_i B_{be}$, or 
as those accepted by a polynomial-time alternating Turing machine 
extended with ``threshold states'' and having at most $i$ alternations.
Likewise, 
the language class accepted by uniform function families of logarithmic height
coincided with languages Karp-reducible to $\quantC_{\log} B_{be}$
and with those accepted by an extended alternating Turing machine with logarithmic alternations.
Since this class contains $\classCH$,
we only state $\classCH$-hard in Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} and Theorem $\ref{KTimesIsCH}$,
but it is not known such class how hard the class is between $\classCH$ and $\classPSPACE$.



\subsection{Families of Real Functions Simulating Difference Equations}
\label{subsection: ode family}
We show that families of smooth differential equations can simulate 
$\classPSPACE$-hard or $\classCH$-hard difference equations stated in previous section.

Before stating Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} and Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily},
we extend the definition of polynomial-time computability of real function
to families of real functions.
A machine $M$ \emph{computes} a family $(f_u)_u$ of functions $f _u \colon A \to \R$ 
indexed by strings $u$
if for any $x \in A$ and any name $\phi_x$ of $x$,
the function taking $v$ to $M ^{\phi _x} (u, v)$ is a name of $f _u (x)$.
We say a family of real functions $(f_u)_u$ is polynomial-time if there is
a polynomial-time machine computing $(f_u)_u$.

 \begin{lemma}
  \label{KTimesFamily}
  There exist a $\classCH$-hard language $L$ and a polynomial $\mu$ 
  such that for all $k \ge 1$ and polynomials $\gamma$,
  there are a polynomial $\rho$ and families $(g_u)_u$, $(h_u)_u$ of real functions
  having following properties that $(g_u)_u$ is polynomial-time computable and for any string $u$:
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item \label{enum:kf:start}
	 $g_u\colon [0,1] \times [-1,1]\to \R$, $h_u\colon [0,1] \to [-1,1]$;
   \item \label{enum:equation}
	 $h_u(0) = 0$ and $\D h_u(t) = g_u(t, h_u(t))$ for all $t \in [0,1]$;
   \item \label{enum:differentiability}
         $g_u$ is $(\infty, k)$-times continuously differentiable;
   \item \label{enum:boundary}
	 $
	 \D^{(i, 0)} g_u(0,y) = \D^{(i, 0)} g_u(1,y) = 0
         $ for all $i \in \N$ and $y \in [-1,1]$;
   \item \label{enum:smooth}
	 $
	 \left|\D^{(i,j)} g_u(t,y)\right| \le 2^{\mu(i, |u|) - \gamma(|u|)}
         $ for all $i \in \N$ and $j \in \{0, \dots, k\}$;
   \item \label{enum:kf:end}
	 $h_u(1) = 2^{-\rho(|u|)} L(u)$.
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
 \label{DifferentiableFamily}
 There exist a $\classPSPACE$-hard language $L$ and a polynomial $\mu$,
 such that for all polynomials $\gamma$,
 there are a polynomial $\rho$ and families $(g_u)_u$, $(h_u)_u$ of real functions
 such that $(g_u)_u$ is polynomial-time computable and for any string $u$
 satisfying (\ref{enum:kf:start})--(\ref{enum:kf:end}) of Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} with $k = 1$.
\end{lemma}

We will prove Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} using Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard} as follows.
Let a function family $(G_u)_u$ be as in Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard},
and let $(H_u)_u$ be the solution of the difference equation given by $(G_u)_u$.
We construct $h_u$ and $g_u$ from $H_u$ and $G_u$ 
such that $h_u(T/2^{q(|u|)}) = \sum^{p(|u|)}_{i = 0} H_u(i, T)/B^{d_u(i)}$ for each $T = 0$, \ldots, $2^{q(|u|)}$
and $\D h_u(t) = g_u(t, h_u(t))$.
The polynomial-time computability of $(g_u)_u$ follows from that of $(G_u)_u$.
We can prove Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily} from Lemma~\ref{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard} in the same way.

In Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily}, 
we have the new conditions (\ref{enum:differentiability})--(\ref{enum:smooth}) 
about the smoothness and the derivatives of $g_u$ 
that were not present in \cite[Lemma 4.1]{kawamura2010lipschitz}.
To satisfy these conditions, we construct $g_u$ 
using the smooth function $f$ in following lemma.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Lemma 3.6]{ko1991complexity}}]
 \label{SmoothFunction}
 There exist a polynomial-time infinitely differentiable function  $f \colon [0,1] \to \R$ 
 and a polynomial $s$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$;
   \item $\D ^n f (0) = \D ^n f (1) = 0$ for all $n \ge 1$;
   \item $f$ is strictly increasing;
   \item $\D ^n f$ is polynomial-time computable for all $n \ge 1$;
   \item \label{enum:polynomial-size}
	 $|\D^n f| \le s(n)$ for all $n \ge 1$. 
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{lemma}

Although the existence of the polynomial~$s$ satisfying the condition (\ref{enum:polynomial-size}) is not stated in \cite[Lemma 3.6]{ko1991complexity},
it can be shown easily.

We only prove Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} here
and omit the analogous and easier proof of Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily}]
Let $L$, $(G_u)_u$ and $(H_u)_u$ be as in Lemma~\ref{DIVPlogIsCHhard},
and let a function family $(H_u)_u$ be the solution of the difference equation given by $(G_u)_u$.

By a similar argument to the beginning of the proof of \cite[Lemma 4.1]{kawamura2010lipschitz},
we may assume that there exist polynomial-time functions $p$, $j_u$
and polynomials $q$, $r$ satisfying the following properties:
\begin{gather}
 G_u \colon [p(|u|)] \times [2^{q(|u|)}] \times [2^{r(|u|)}] \to \{-1, 0, 1\},
 \\
 H_u(i, 2^{q(|u|)}) = \begin{cases}
		       L(u) & \text{if} \ i=p(|u|), \\
		       0 & \text{if} \ i<p(|u|), 
		      \end{cases}
 \\
 i \not = j_u(T)  \to G_u(i, T, Y) = 0.
\end{gather}
Since $G_u$ has logarithmic height,
there exists a polynomial $\sigma$ such that $(k+1)^{p(x)} \le \sigma(x)$


We construct the families of real functions $(g_u)_u$ and $(h_u)_u$ simulating $G _u$ and $H _u$ 
in the sense that $h_u(T/2^{q(|u|)}) = \sum^{p(|u|)}_{i = 0}H_u(i, T)/B^{d_u(i)}$, 
where the constant $B$ and the function $d_u \colon [p(|u|)+1] \to \N$ are 
defined by
  \begin{align}
   B &= 2^{\gamma(|u|) + r(|u|) + s(k) + k + 3}, 
   &
   d_u(i) &= 
   \begin{cases}
    \sigma(|u|) & \text{if} \ i=p(|u|), 
    \\
    (k+1)^i & \text{if} \ i<p(|u|).
   \end{cases}
  \end{align}
For each $(t, y) \in [0,1] \times [-1, 1]$,
there exist unique $N \in \N$, $\theta \in [0,1)$, $Y \in \Z$ and $\eta \in [-1/4, 3/4)$
such that $t = (T + \theta)2^{-q(|u|)}$ and $y = (Y + \eta)B^{-d_u(j_u(T))}$.
Using $f$ and a polynomial $s$ of Lemma~\ref{SmoothFunction},
we define 
$\delta_{u,Y} \colon [0,1] \to \R$,
$
g _u \colon [0, 1] \times [-1, 1] \to \R
$ and $
h _u \colon [0, 1] \to [-1, 1]
$ by
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:delta}
   \delta_{u, Y} (t) &= \frac{2^{q(|u|)} \D f(\theta)}{B^{d_u(j_u(T)+1)}} 
   G_u \bigl( j_u(T), T, Y \bmod 2^{r(|u|)} \bigr),
   \\
  \label{eq:gu}
  g_u(t,y) 
  &= \begin{cases}
     \delta_{u, Y}(t)
     & \text{if} \ \eta \le \frac 1 4, 
     \\
     ( 1-f ( \frac{4\eta-1}{2})) \delta_{u, Y}(t)
     + f ( \frac{4\eta-1}{2}) \delta_{u,Y+1}(t)
     & \text{if} \ \eta > \frac 1 4,
    \end{cases}
   \\
  h_u(t) 
   &= \sum^{p(|u|)}_{i=0} \frac{H_u(i, T)}{B^{d_u(i)}}  
  + \frac{f(\theta)}{B^{d_u(j_u(T)+1)}} G_u \bigl( j_u(T), T, H_u(j_u(T), T) \bigr) .
  \label{eq:hu}
  \end{align}

We will verify that $(g_u)_u$ and $(h_u)_u$ defined above satisfy all the conditions stated in Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily}.
The condition~(\ref{enum:equation}) are verified by the same argument as
\cite[Lemma 4.1]{kawamura2010lipschitz}.

We will show that the condition~(\ref{enum:differentiability}) holds, that is, $g _u$ is $(\infty, k)$-times continuously differentiable.
For each $i \in \N$,
  \begin{align}
   \D^i \delta_{u,Y}(t) 
&
    = \frac{2^{(i+1)q(|u|)} \D^{i+1}f(\theta)}{B^{d_u(j_u(T)+1)}}
    G_u\bigl( j_u(T),\ T,\ Y \bmod 2^{r(|u|)} \bigr),
\\
   \label{eq:derivativeofgu}
    \D^{(i,0)} g_u(t, y)
&
     = \begin{cases}
 	\D^i \delta_{u, Y}(t) 
	& \text{if} \ - \frac 1 4 < \eta < \frac 1 4, \\
	\left( 1-f \left(\frac{4\eta-1}{2}\right)\right) 
	\D^i \delta_{u, Y}(t)
	+ f \left(\frac{4\eta-1}{2}\right) \D^i \delta_{u,Y+1}(t) 
	& \text{if} \ \frac 1 4 < \eta < \frac 3 4,
       \end{cases}
  \end{align}
and for each  $j \in \{1, \dots , k\}$,
  \begin{equation}
    \D^{(i,j)} g_u(t, y)
     = \begin{cases}
	0 & \text{if} \ - \frac 1 4 < \eta < \frac 1 4, \\
	(2B^{d_u(j_u(T))})^j \D^j f(\frac{4\eta - 1}2)
	(\D^i \delta_{u,Y+1}(t)-\D^i \delta_{u, Y}(t)) 
	& \text{if} \ \frac 1 4 < \eta < \frac 3 4.
       \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
It is easy to check that they are also continuous on the boundaries 
($\theta = 0$ and $\eta = -1/4, 3/4$).
Hence $g _u$ is $(\infty, j)$-times continuously differentiable.
Substituting $t = 0, 1$ ($\theta = 0$) into \eqref{eq:derivativeofgu},
we get $\D^{(i, 0)} g_u(0,y) = \D^{(i, 0)} g_u(1,y) = 0$, 
so the condition (\ref{enum:boundary}) holds.

We show that the condition (\ref{enum:smooth}) holds with $\mu(x, y) = (x+1)q(y) + s(x+1)$.
Note that $\mu$ is a polynomial independent of $k$ and $\gamma$.
Since $|\D^i \delta_{u,Y}(t)| \le 2^{(i+1)q(|u|) + s(i+1)}B^{-d_u(j_u(|u|)+1)}$ by \eqref{eq:delta}, for all $i \in \N$ and $j \in \{0, \dots, k\}$, we have
 \begin{equation}
  |\D^{(i,j)} g_u| 
   \le 
   2^k B^{k \cdot j_u(T)} 2^{s(k)} \cdot 2 \cdot 
   \frac{2^{(i+1)q(|u|) + s(i+1)}}{B^{d_u(j_u(|u|)+1)}} 
   \le
   \frac{2^{\mu(i, |u|) + s(k) + k + 1}}{B}
   \le
   2^{\mu(i, |u|) - \gamma(|u|)}
 \end{equation}
 by our choice of $B$.

We have (\ref{enum:kf:end}) with
  $\rho(x) = \sigma(x) \cdot (\gamma(x)+r(x)+s(k)+k+3)$, because
  \begin{equation}
   h_u(1) = \frac{H_u(p(|u|), 2^{q(|u|)})}{B^{d_u(p(|u|))}} 
          = \frac{L(u)}{2^{\sigma(|u|) \cdot (\gamma(|u|)+r(|u|)+s(k)+k+3)}}
	  = 2^{-\rho(|u|)} L(u).
  \end{equation}
 \end{proof}



 To prove Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily}, 
 let a function family $(G_u)_u$ be as Lemma~\ref{DIVPpolyIsPSPACEhard}
 and let $(H_u)_u$ be the solution of the difference equation given by $(G_u)_u$,
 and define $(g_u)_u$ and $(h_u)_u$ as \eqref{eq:gu} and \eqref{eq:hu}
 with $d_u(i) = i$.
 It is shown in the same way as above that they meet all the conditions
 stated in Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily}.


\subsection{Proof of the Main Theorems}
\label{subsection: proof of theorems}
Using the function families $(g_u)_u$ and $(h_u)_u$ 
obtained from Lemmas \ref{KTimesFamily} or \ref{DifferentiableFamily}, 
we construct the functions $g$ and $h$ in 
Theorems \ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} and \ref{KTimesIsCH} as follows. 
Divide $[0,1)$ into infinitely many subintervals $[l^-_u, l^+_u]$,
with midpoints $c_u$.
We construct $h$ by putting a scaled copy of $h_u$ onto $[l^-_u, c_u]$ and
putting a horizontally reversed scaled copy of $h_u$ onto $[c_u, l^+_u]$ 
so that $h(l^-_u) = 0$, $h(c_u) = 2^{-\rho'(|u|)} L(u)$ and $h(l^+_u) = 0$ where $\rho'$ is a polynomial.
In the same way, $g$ is constructed from $(g_u)_u$ so that $g$ and $h$ satisfy \eqref{eq:ode}.
We give the details of the proof of 
Theorem~\ref{KTimesIsCH} from Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily}, 
and omit the analogous proof of Theorem~\ref{DifferentiableIsPspace} 
from Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily}. 


\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{KTimesIsCH}]
Let $L$ and $\mu$ be as Lemma~\ref{DifferentiableFamily}.
Define
 \begin{align}
  \lambda(x) &= 2x + 2,&
  \gamma(x) &= x \mu(x, x) + x \lambda(x).
 \end{align}
and for each $u$
\begin{align}
 \Lambda_u 
 &= 2^{\lambda(|u|)}, &
 c_u 
 &= 1-\frac{1}{2^{|u|}}+\frac{2\bar{u}+1}{\Lambda_u}, &
 l_u^\mp 
 &= c_u\mp\frac{1}{\Lambda_u}
\end{align}  
 where $\bar u \in \{0, \dots, 2^{|u|} - 1\}$ is the number represented by $u$ as binary expression.
Let $\rho$, $(g_u)_u$, $(h_u)_u$ be as Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} with $\gamma$.

We define
 \begin{align} \label{eq:g}
 g \left(l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u}, \frac{y}{\Lambda_u}\right)
  &= \begin{cases}
      \pm \displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{\D^{(0,l)}g_u(t,1)}{l!} (y-1)^l 
      &  (1<y) \\
      \pm g_u(t, y)      & (-1 \le y \le 1) \\
      \pm \displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{\D^{(0,l)}g_u(t,-1)}{l!} (y+1)^l  
      &  (1<y) \\
    \end{cases} 
  \\
 h \left( l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u} \right) 
  & = \frac{h_u(t)}{\Lambda_u}
\end{align}
for each string $u$, $t \in [0,1)$, $y \in [-1, 1]$.
Let $g(1,y) = 0$ and $h(1) = 0$ for any $y \in [-1,1]$

It can be shown in a similar way as the Lipschitz version 
that $g$ and $h$ satisfy \eqref{eq:ode} and $g$ is polynomial-time computable,
so see the proof of \cite[Theorem 3.2]{kawamura2010lipschitz} for more details.
We only show that $g$ is $(\infty, k)$-times continuously differentiable.

For each $i \in \N$ and $j \in \{0, \dots, k\}$ differentiating \eqref{eq:g} $(i,j)$-times,
\begin{equation}
   \D^{(i, j)}g \left(l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u}, \frac{y}{\Lambda_u}\right)
   = \begin{cases}
      \pm \Lambda_u^{(i, j)} \sum^{k}_{l=j} \frac{\D^{(i,l)} g_u(t,1)}{(l-j)!}
      (y - 1)^l &  (1<y)
      \\
      \pm \Lambda_u^{(i,j)} \D^{(i, j)} g_u(t, y) & (-1 < y < 1)
      \\
      \pm \Lambda_u^{(i, j)} \sum^{k}_{l=j} 
      \frac{\D^{(i,l)} g_u(t, -1)}{(l-j)!} (y + 1)^l &  (1<y).
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
for $t \in (0, 1)$ and $y \in [-\Lambda_u, \Lambda_u]$ where $y \neq -1, 1$.
It is continuous where $t \in (0,1)$ and $y \not = -1, 1$
since each $\D^{(i,j)}g_u$ is continuous.
We can verify that it is continuous on the boundary($t = 0, 1$ or $y = -1, 1$)
by the definition and Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} (\ref{enum:boundary}).
Finally we show that it is continuous at 1 for the first variable.
By Lemma~\ref{KTimesFamily} (\ref{enum:smooth}),
 \begin{align}
  \left|\D^{(i, j)}g \left(l^\mp_u \pm \frac{t}{\Lambda_u},
  \frac{y}{\Lambda_u}\right)\right|
  &\le 
  \Lambda_u^{i+j} \sum^{k}_{l=j} |\D^{(i,l)} g_u | (\Lambda_u + 1)^l 
  \notag
  \\
  & \le \Lambda_u^{i+j+k}  2^{k + \mu(i, |u|) - \gamma(|u|)}
   =  2^{(i+j+k)\lambda(|u|) + k + \mu(i, |u|)  - \gamma(|u|)}. 
  \label{eq:sizeofderivative}
 \end{align}
While $|u| \to \infty$, \eqref{eq:sizeofderivative} correspondingly approaches to $0$ by our choice of $\gamma$.
Hence $\lim_{t \to 1-0}\D^{(i,j)} g(t,y) = g(1, y) = 0$.
and we complete to show that $g$ is $(\infty, k)$-times continuously differentiable.
\end{proof}
